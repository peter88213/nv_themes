## If you just want a dark mode

If you just want a dark mode for *novelibre*, do install the 
[nv_dark](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_dark/) plugin instead of *nv_themes*.
Changing the theme is not enough to get a dark mode. 
You also need a modified color palette so that the colored text stands out 
against the dark background. *nv_dark* comes with such a color palette. 

## Side note

Actually, this plugin is more intended for Linux, where the default theme looks pretty stale, and there are plenty of desktops, each with a different look.

On Windows, *novelibre* uses a lot of native widgets by default, you can hardly do better with custom themes.

## Requirements

- [novelibre](https://github.com/peter88213/novelibre/) version 5.0+
- To have a [wider choice](https://ttkthemes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/themes.html), you may want to [install the ttkthemes package](https://ttkthemes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

## Download and install

### Default: Executable Python zip archive

Download the latest release [nv_themes_v5.0.3.pyz](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_themes/raw/main/dist/nv_themes_v5.0.3.pyz)

- Launch *nv_themes_v5.0.3.pyz* by double-clicking (Windows desktop),
- or execute `python nv_themes_v5.0.3.pyz` (Windows), resp. `python3 nv_themes_v5.0.3.pyz` (Linux) on the command line.

#### Important

Many web browsers recognize the download as an executable file and offer to open it immediately. 
This starts the installation under Windows.

However, depending on your security settings, your browser may 
initially  refuse  to download the executable file. 
In this case, your confirmation or an additional action is required. 
If this is not possible, you have the option of downloading 
the zip file. 


### Alternative: Zip file

The package is also available in zip format: [nv_themes_v5.0.3.zip](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_themes/raw/main/dist/nv_themes_v5.0.3.zip)

- Extract the *nv_themes_v5.0.3* folder from the downloaded zipfile "nv_themes_v5.0.3.zip".
- Move into this new folder and launch *setup.py* by double-clicking (Windows/Linux desktop), 
- or execute `python setup.py` (Windows), resp. `python3 setup.py` (Linux) on the command line.
