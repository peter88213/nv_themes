# nv_themes

The [novelibre](https://github.com/peter88213/novelibre/) Python program helps authors organize novels.  

*nv_themes* is a plugin providing a theme changer dialog.

## Side note

Actually, the plugin is more intended for Linux, where the default theme looks pretty stale, and there are plenty of desktops, each with a different look.

On Windows, *novelibre* uses a lot of native widgets by default, you can hardly do better with custom themes.

## Requirements

- [novelibre](https://github.com/peter88213/novelibre/) version 4.0+
- To have a [wider choice](https://ttkthemes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/themes.html), you may want to [install the ttkthemes package](https://ttkthemes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

## Download and install

[Download the latest release (version 0.99.0)](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_themes/raw/main/dist/nv_themes_v0.99.0.zip)

- Extract the "nv_themes_v0.99.0" folder from the downloaded zipfile "nv_themes_v0.99.0.zip".
- Move into this new folder and launch **setup.pyw**. This installs the plugin for the local user.
